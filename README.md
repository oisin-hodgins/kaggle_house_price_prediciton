# kaggle_house_price_prediciton
My attempt at the following Kaggle competition: "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques".

Includes data exploration, feature engineering and gradient boosting regression.
My attempt at the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" challenge on kaggle, available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview" >here</a>.

This is by no means an expert or perfect solution, however it dis achieve a top `15%` position on the leaderboard with a score of `0.12402`, using gradient boosting regression.

This brief report includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and model design.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone this repository.

This jupyter notebook uses the following python packages:
`numpy`

Output can be seen in the `submissions.csv` file.

## Reflection

This is a project undertaken for fun.

The primary goal of this project was to practice machine learning an data processing techniques in python. This goal has been fully realised.

Ps. Never forget to convert your reverse your log transformation after the final prediciton!
